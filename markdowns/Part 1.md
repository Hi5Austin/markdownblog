After my first year at college, I think I finally understood what K . was talking about. Yo, when I say freshman year fucked me up, I mean it fucked me uuupppp. I
described it to my friend like this. Imagine working 4 years to get tickets to
what's supposed to be the littest party of your entire life, only to get there
and find out midway through that it's actually a prison. Now imagine, every
other night there's an 80% percent chance you have an encounter with the
Boondock's infamous Booty Warrior which you barely escape from. Now the whole time
everyone is telling you it's fine, but actually everything is on fire.
The smallest things that keep you sane have to be relentlessy
fought for, and all your friends are always on the brink of a breakdown. When
I say I ate jello every day for the last 8 weeks to remember better times, that
jello was the best part of my day for the better part of 2 months, I am not gassing you.
Yeah I know, sounds lit right? You finally get to leave the house after 9 months,
but did the house really leave you?

The first two weeks back in NYC (Deadass, bacon, egg, and cheese runs through
my veins b) were awful. It felt like I was still in Claremont, I was having
flashbacks of probelm sets, protests, and emotional breakdowns I really didn't
want to have. Summer would eventually ease the pain, but the damage was done.
Looking back I can't believe all the shit that happened that year, and I will
defintley write a more detailed account of my persepective, but this website is
about moving forward, not looking back.
